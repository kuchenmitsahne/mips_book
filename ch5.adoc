== Chapter 5: Functions and the MIPS Calling Convention

While I'm sure everyone here probably knows what functions are, and we'll cover
them in assembly shortly, you might be wondering what a "Calling Convention" is.
In short, it is an agreement between the caller and callee about how to treat/use
certain registers.  We'll get to the why and how later.


=== Functions

In assembly, a function is simply a label with a return instruction associated with it;
because this is far more ambiguous than a function in a higher level language, it
is good practice to only have a single return instruction associated with a
function.{one_return}  A comment above the label is also helpful.  Together those help you
quickly see the start and end of the function.

[source,c,linenums]
----
void func1() {}
----

would be

[source,mips,linenums]
----
# void func1()
func1:
	# body goes here
	jr     $ra
----

As you can see my policy is to put a single line comment of the C prototype above
label.

But how do you call a function in assembly?  You use the instruction Jump and Link:
`jal func_label`.
Let's change the hello world program from chapter 0 to call a function:


[source,mips,linenums]
----
.data
hello:   .asciiz "Hello World!\n"

.text
main:
	jal  hello_world

	li   $v0, 10     # exit syscall
	syscall


# void hello_world()
hello_world:
	li   $v0, 4      # print string system call
	la   $a0, hello  # load address of string to print into a0
	syscall

	jr  $ra

----

What `jal` actually does, is save the address of the next instruction to `$ra`
and then do an unconditional jump to the function label.  So you could achieve
the same results with the following:

----
	jal    func

	# is equivalent to

	la     $ra, next_instr
	j      func
next_instr:
----

That would get tiring and ugly fast though, having to come up with unique labels
for the next instruction every time.  You also might be confused about why the
greensheet says `jal` saves PC+8 in `$ra` instead of PC+4.  The reason
is that MIPS technically has delayed branching, i.e. a single instruction after
every branch instruction is executed before the jump actually happens.  So `jal`
adds 8 instead of 4 to account for that extra instruction delay.  However,
every simulator we've mentioned does non-delayed branching by default so you
can ignore it.

// TODO I'll cover using delayed branching in the chapter covering stupid prof
// requirements like not using pseudoinstructions etc.

=== The Convention

We've gone as far as we can without starting to talk about registers and their
purposes in functions.  You can think of registers as variables{zero_reg} that
are part of the CPU.  In this case, since we're dealing with a 32-bit MIPS
architecture, they are 32-bit (aka 4 bytes, 1 word) variables.  Since they're
part of the CPU, they exist for the life of the program and the whole program
shares the same registers.

But how does that work?  If all parts of the program use the same
32 registers, how does one function not stomp all over what another was doing
when it uses them?  In fact, how do functions communicate at all?  How do they
pass arguments or return results?  All these questions are solved by deciding
on a "Calling Convention".  It's different for different architectures and even
different operating systems on the same architecture.  This is because different
architectures have different numbers of registers, and some registers like `$ra`
have hardcoded uses.  The op `jal` modifies `$ra`, and `$0` is a constant 0 and
there's no way to change either of those facts.  That still leaves a lot of
flexibility about designing a calling convention.  While they mostly match,
you'll find several variations of MIPS calling conventions online.  They
usually differ in how they setup a stack frame.  The convention covered
in this chapter is consistent with, and sufficient for, almost every college
course I've ever heard of.

Regardless, what matters is that the calling convention works by setting rules
(and guidelines) for register use, and when/how to use the stack.

If you're unfamiliar with the
runtime stack, it's exactly what it sounds like.  It's a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO)
data structure that you can use to store smaller values in a program.  It grows
in a negative direction, so to allocate 12 bytes, you would subtract 12 from the
stack pointer (in MIPS that's `$sp`).

MIPS specifically designates certain registers to be used for passing arguments
(at least the first 4), others for return values, and others for misc. temporary
or saved values.  The rest are special use registers like `$ra`.

The quickest way to summarize is to look at the table
on the greensheet which is reproduced (with some modifications) below:


.MIPS Registers and Uses
[cols="1,1,3,1"]
|===
| Name | Number | Use | Preserved Across a Call

| $zero | 0 | Constant 0 | N.A.

| $at | 1 | Assembler Temporary (used to expand pseudo-ops) | No

| $v0-$v1 | 2-3 | Function Results and Expression Evaluation | No

| $a0-$a3 | 4-7 | Arguments | No

| $t0-$t7 | 8-15 | Temporaries | No

| $s0-$s7 | 16-23 | Saved Temporaries | Yes

| $t8-$t9 | 24-25 | Temporaries | No

| $k0-$k1 | 26-27 | Reserved for OS Kernel | No

| $gp | 28 | Global Pointer | Yes

| $sp | 29 | Stack Pointer | Yes

| $fp (or $s8) | 30 | Frame Pointer if necessary or can be another saved reg | Yes

| $ra | 31 | Return Address | No

|===

To summarize, you have 16 registers that can be used anytime for temporary
values, though some have special uses too (the v, a, and t registers).
You have 8 s registers that have to be saved on the stack if you use
them, plus `$ra` as well.  The `$zero` register is obviously a special case.

The `$sp` register is technically preserved but not in the same way.  Basically
what you allocate (subtract) you have to deallocate (add) before returning
from a function, thus preserving the original value.

You can ignore `$at, $k0-$k1, $gp` and most of the time `$fp` too.  In over 5 years
of tutoring I've helped students with MIPS from at least 2 dozen different colleges
and I think I've only seen a professor force his students to use `$fp`
or pass more than 4 arguments twice.  You can see{fp_is_s8} register 30 sometimes
referred to as `$s8` rather than, or in addition to, `$fp` which shows you how rarely
it's actually used/needed as a frame pointer.

==== Basic example

Let's start with something simple that doesn't use the stack.

----
int hello_name_number(char* name, int number)
{
	printf("Hello %s!\n", name);
	return number*10;
}
----

According to the convention that becomes:

----
.data
hello_space:  .asciiz "Hello "
exclaim_nl:   .asciiz "!\n"

.text
# int hello_name_number(char* name, int number)
hello_name_number:
	move    $t0, $a0   # save name in t0 since we need a0 for the syscall

	li      $v0, 4        # print string
	la      $a0, hello_space
	syscall

	move      $a0, $t0    # print name (v0 is still 4)
	syscall

	la        $a0, exclaim_nl  # print "!\n"
	syscall


	addi    $v0, $a1, 10  # return number+10
	jr      $ra
----

Some things to note, syscalls are not function calls so we can "save" `$a0` in
a t register and know that it'll still be there when the syscall is done.  In the
same way, we know that `$v0` is still the same so we don't have to keep setting
it to 4 for print string.  Lastly, to return a value, we make sure that value
is in `$v0` before returning.

==== Using the Stack

Ok, first let's establish the rules on when you _have_ to use the stack (You can
always use it for arbitrary local variables, like a local array for example, but
generally don't if you don't have a good reason).

. *You call another function, ie you're a non-leaf function.*
+
This means you have to save `$ra` on the stack at the very least, otherwise when you
do your `jr $ra` you'd jump back into yourself (right after the last `jal` instruction).
This does not apply to main because you don't/shouldn't return from main, you should
call the exit (or exit2) syscall (10 or 17).

. *You need to save values across a function call (automatically includes reason 1).*
+
This is fairly common for non-trivial functions. Obvious examples are calling a
function in a loop or loops (you'd have to preserve the iterator(s)), and
many recursive functions.

. *You run out of temporary registers and overflow into the s registers.*
+
This is very rare.  The most common reason this "happens" is people forget they have
10 t registers instead of 8 like s registers and even if they remember that they
forget they can also use the a and v registers for temporaries.  16 is more than
enough to handle pretty much any function because you rarely need 17 discrete values
at the same time.

Ok let's look at an example for the first two.  Any example for the last rule
would be prohibitively large and complicated.


[source,c,linenums]
----
int non_leaf()
{
	func1();
	return 42
}
----

This calls the empty function discussed at the top of this chapter.

[source,mips,linenums]
----
#int non_leaf()
non_leaf:
	addi    $sp, $sp, -4  # space to save 1 register, $ra
	sw      $ra, 0($sp)   # store $ra in the newly allocated stack space

	jal     func1

	li      $v0, 42       # return 42

	lw      $ra, 0($sp)   # restore original $ra
	addi    $sp, $sp, 4   # pop the stack
	jr      $ra
----

The bit of code at the top and bottom of the function are called the prologue
and epilogue respectively for obvious reasons.  We allocate 4 bytes on the stack
by subtracting 4 (I add a negative rather than subtract
because I can copy-paste the line with a single character change for the
epilogue).  Then we store the current `$ra` in that space at the new top of the
stack.  Then before we exit we have to load it back and pop the stack.

If we didn't save and restore `$ra` we would jump to line 7 when we do our
`jr $ra` and then we'd be in an infinite loop.

Next we have the second case, where we need to preserve regular local values
across a function call.

[source,c,linenums]
----
void print_letters(char letter, int count)
{
	for (int i=0; i<count; i++) {
		putchar(letter);
	}
	putchar('\n');
}

int save_vals()
{
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
		print_letters('A'+i, i+1);
	}
	return 8;
}
----

That becomes this in mips:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
#void print_letters(char letter, int count)
print_letters:
	ble     $a1, $0, exit_pl   # if (count <= 0) goto exit_pl
	li      $v0, 11            # print character
pl_loop:
	syscall
	addi    $a1, $a1, -1       # count--
	bgt     $a1, $0, pl_loop   # while (count > 0)

	li      $a0, 10            # '\n'
	syscall
	
exit_pl:
	jr      $ra


#int save_vals()
save_vals:
	addi    $sp, $sp, -12
	sw      $ra, 0($sp)
	sw      $s0, 4($sp)
	sw      $s1, 8($sp)

	li      $s0, 0  # i = 0
	li      $s1, 10
sv_loop:
	addi    $a0, $s0, 65   # i + 'A'
	addi    $a1, $s0, 1    # i + 1
	jal     print_letters

	addi    $s0, $s0, 1        # i++
	blt     $s0, $s1, sv_loop  # while (i < 10)

	lw      $ra, 0($sp)
	lw      $s0, 4($sp)
	lw      $s1, 8($sp)
	addi    $sp, $sp, 12
	jr      $ra
----

Notice that for print_letters, we not only convert the loop to a `do-while`, but
we also use the parameter `count` as the iterator to count _down_ to 0.  It saves
us an instruction initializing an `i`.

Second, for `save_vals`, we save not only `$ra` because we call another function,
but also two s registers to save `i` and our stopping point.  The second is not
actually necessary.  Because it's a constant, we could load 10 into a register
right before the check every iteration of the loop.  Which version is better depends on
several factors, like how long or complex the loop is, how many times it executes, and
of course personal preference.

==== Recursive Functions

Let's do a classic recursive function, the fibonacci sequence.

[source,c,linenums]
----
int fib(int n)
{
	if (n <= 1)
		return n;

	return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1);
}

----

You can see how, at the very least, we'll have to save `$ra` and `n`, because we
need the original even after the first recursive call.  It's not as
obvious, but we'll also have to save the return value of the first call so
we'll still have it to do the addition after the second.  You might think
this would require using two s regs, but does it?  Let's see...

[source,mips,linenums]
----
#int fib(int n)
fib:
	addi    $sp, $sp, -8
	sw      $ra, 0($sp)
	sw      $s0, 4($sp)

	move    $v0, $a0        # prepare to return n
	li      $t0, 1
	ble     $a0, $t0, exit_fib  # if (n <= 1) goto exit_fib (ie return n)

	move    $s0, $a0        # save n

	addi    $a0, $a0, -2    # a0 = n - 2
	jal     fib             # fib(n-2)

	addi    $a0, $s0, -1    # a0 = n - 1, prep arg first so we can use s0 to save v0
	move    $s0, $v0        # save return of fib(n-2) in s0
	jal     fib             # fib(n-1)

	add     $v0, $v0, $s0   #  v0 = fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

exit_fib:
	lw      $ra, 0($sp)
	lw      $s0, 4($sp)
	addi    $sp, $sp, 8
	jr      $ra
----

Notice how we don't have to save `n` any sooner than necessary, ie right before
we have to use `$a0` to setup the first recursive call.  Also, the ordering of
lines 16 and 17 is important.  We needed the original `n` to calculate `n-1` but
once that's in `$a0` ready for the call, because we won't need `n` again afterward,
we can now use `$s0` to preserve the return value of the first call.

Some of you, if you were paying attention, might point out that you could save
a few instructions of performance if you moved the base case testing before the
prologue as long as you put the exit label after the epilogue.  This is true,
but I'd recommend against it unless you were really trying to eke out every last
microsecond.  It's nicer/cleaner to keep the prologue and epilogue as the
first and last things; they're one more thing to catch your eye and help delineate
where functions start and end.  Regardless, if you're curious, you can see that
version, along with every other function in this chapter in the included program
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rswinkle/mips_book/master/code/calling.s[calling.s].

// TODO A recursive function that doesn't require saving anything but $ra

=== Conclusion

While grasping the basics of a calling convention is not too difficult, it takes
practice to get used to it.  There are many things that we haven't covered
in this chapter, like how to pass more than 4 arguments, or use `$fp`, or handle
floating point arguments or return values.  The latter at least, will be covered in
the next chapter.
