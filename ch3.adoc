== Chapter 3: Branches and Logic

We can't go much farther in our MIPS programming journey without covering branching.
Almost every non-trivial program requires some logic, even if it's only a few `if` or
`if-else` statements.  In other words, almost every program requires branching, a way
to do a instead of b, or to do a only if certain conditions are met.

You already know how to do this in higher level languages, the aforementioned `if`
statement.  In assembly it's more complicated.  Your only tool is the ability
to jump to a label on another line based on the result of various comparisons.  The
relevant instructions are listed in the following table:


.MIPS branching related instructions (and pseudoinstructions)
[cols="3,1,2,2"]
|===
| Name | Opcode | Format | Operation

| Branch On Equal | beq | beq rs, rt, label | if (rs == rt) goto label

| Branch On Not Equal | bne | bne rs, rt, label | if (rs != rt) goto label

| Branch Less Than | blt | blt rs, rt, label | if (rs < rt) goto label

| Branch Greater Than | bgt | bgt rs, rt, label | if (rs > rt) goto label

| Branch Less Than Or Equal | ble | ble rs, rt, label | if (rs <= rt) goto label

| Branch Greater Than Or Equal | bge | bge rs, rt, label | if (rs >= rt) goto label

| Set Less Than | slt | slt rd, rs, rt | rd = (rs < rt) ? 1 : 0

| Set Less Than Immediate | slti | slt rd, rs, imm | rd = (rs < imm) ? 1 : 0

| Set Less Than Immediate Unsigned | sltiu | slt rd, rs, imm | rd = (rs < imm) ? 1 : 0

| Set Less Than Unsigned | sltu | sltu rd, rs, imm | rd = (rs < imm) ? 1 : 0

|===

You can see the same information and more (like which ones are pseudoinstructions)
on the MIPS greensheet.{greensheet}

There are additional pseudoinstructions in the form of beq/bne/blt/bgt/ble/bge + 'z' which
are syntactic sugar to compare a register against 0, ie the 0 register.

So the following:
----
	beq     $t0, $0, label
	bne     $t1, $0, label
	blt     $t2, $0, label
----
would be equivalent to:
----
	beqz    $t0, label
	bnez    $t1, label
	bltz    $t2, label
----

Note `$0` is the same as `zero` and is the hard coded 0 register.  I'll cover
registers in xref:ch5.adoc#_the_convention[more detail] in the chapter on functions and the calling conventions.

One final thing is that labels have the same naming requirements as C variables and
functions.  They must start with a letter or underscore and the rest can be letters,
underscores, or digits.

=== Practice

The rest of this chapter will be going over many examples, looking at snippets
of code in C and translating them to MIPS.

==== Basics

Let's start with the most basic if statement.  The code in and after
the if statement is arbitrary.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a > 0) {
		a++;
	}
	a *= 2;
----

Now in MIPS, let's assume that a is in `$t0`.  The tranlation would look
like this:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	ble   $t0, $0, less_eq_0    # if (a <= 0) goto less_eq_0
	addi  $t0, $t0, 1           # a++
less_eq_0:
	sll   $t0, $t0, 1           # a *= 2  (shifting left by n is multiplying by 2^n)
----

There are a few things to note in this example.  The first is that in assembly
we test for the opposite of what was in the if statement.  This will always be
the case when jumping forward because (if we want to keep the same order of code)
we can only jump _over_ a block of code, whereas in C we fall into the block if
the condition is true.  In the process of mentally compiling a bit of C to
assembly, it can be helpful to some to change to jump based
logic first.  For example the previous C would become:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a <= 0)
		goto less_eq_0;
	a++;
less_eq_0:
	a *= 2;
----

This is obviously still valid C but matches the branching behavior of assembly
exactly.  You can see I put comments for the equivalent C code in my assembly;
it helps with readability to comment every line or group of lines that way.

The second thing to notice is how we handled the multiplication.  This has
nothing to do with branching but is something we'll touch on multiple times
throughout the book.  Your job when acting as a human compiler is to match the
_behavior_. You are under no obligation to match the structure or operations
of the higher level code exactly (unless your professor stupidly forces you to).

Given that, it is in your best interest to change and rearrange things in
order to simplify the assembly as much as possible to make your life easier.
Generally speaking, this also tends to result in more performant code, since
using fewer instructions and fewer branches (the most common outcomes) saves
execution time.

In this case, the standard `mult` instruction (from the green sheet) would have
required 3 instructions, and even the `mul` instruction (that does seem to
be supported everywhere but is not on the green sheet) would take 2:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	li    $t1, 2
	mult  $t0, $t1
	mflo  $t0           # a *= 2

	# or

	li    $t1, 2
	mul   $t0, $t0, $t1   # a *= 2
----

Given that, when multiplying or dividing by a power of 2 it's common practice
to use `sll` or `sra`.  This is true in all assembly languages because
multiplication and division are relatively costly operations so using shifts
when you can saves performance even if you didn't actually save instructions.

Ok, let's look at an `if-else` example.  Again, the actual code is arbitrary and
we're assuming a and b are in `$t0` and `$t1` respectively

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a > 0) {
		b = 100;
	} else {
		b -= 50;
	}
----

You could do it something like these two ways

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	bgt    $t0, $0, greater_0   # if (a > 0) goto greater_0
	addi   $t1, $t1, -50        # b -= 50
	j      less_eq_0
greater_0:
	li     $t1, 100             # b = 100
less_eq_0:

	# or

	ble    $t0, $0, less_eq0    # if (a <= 0) goto less_eq_0
	li     $t1, 100             # b = 100
	j      greater_0
less_eq_0:
	addi   $t1, $t1, -50        # b -= 50
greater_0:
----

You can see how the first swaps the order of the actual code which keeps the
actual conditions the same as in C, while the second does what we discussed
before and inverts the condition in order keep the the blocks in the same
order.  In both cases, an extra unconditional branch and label is necessary
so we don't fall through the else case.  This is inefficient and wasteful,
not to mention complicates the code unecessarily.  Remember how our job
is to match the behavior, not the exact structure?  Imagine how we could
rewrite it in C to simplify the logic:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	b -= 50;
	if (a > 0) {
		b = 100;
	}
----

which becomes

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	addi   $t1, $t1, -50        # b -= 50;
	ble    $t0, $0, less_eq_0   # if (a <= 0) goto less_eq_0
	li     $t1, 100             # b = 100
less_eq_0:
----

That is a simple example of rearranging code to make your life easier.
In this case, we are taking advantage of what the code is doing to make a
default path or default case.  Obviously, because of the nature of the code
subtracting 50 has to be the default since setting b to 100 overwrites
the original value which we'd need if we were supposed to subtract 50 instead.
In cases where you can't avoid destructive changes (like where the condition and the
code are using/modifying the same variable), you can use a temporary variable;
i.e. copy the value into a spare register.  You still save yourself an unecessary
jump and label.

==== Compound Conditions

These first 2 examples have been based on simple conditions, but what if you
have compound conditions?  How does that work with branch operations that only
test a single condition?  As you might expect, you have to break things down
to match the logic using the operations you have.

Let's look at *and* first.  Variables a, b, and c are in t0, t1, and t2.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a > 10 && a < b) {
		c += 20;
	}
	b &= 0xFF;
----

So what's our first step?  Like previous examples, we need to test
for the opposite when we switch to assembly, so we need the equivalent of

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (!(a > 10 && a < b))
		goto no_add20;
	c += 20;
no_add20:
	b &= 0xFF;
----

That didn't help us much because we still don't know how to handle that compound
condition.  In fact we've made it more complicated.  If only there were
a way to convert it to *or* instead of *and*.  Why would we want that?  Because,
while both *and* and *or* in C allow for short circuit evaluation (where
the result of the whole expression is known early and the rest of expression
is not evaluated), with *or*, it short circuits on success while *and* short
circuits on failure.  What does that mean?  It means that with *or*, the whole
expression is true the second a single true term is found, while with *and*
the whole expression is false the second a single false term is found.

Let's look at the following code to demonstrate:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a || b || c) {
		something;
	}

	// What does this actually look like if we rewrote it to show what it's
	// actually doing with short circuit evaluation?

	if (a) goto do_something;
	if (b) goto do_something;
	if (c) goto do_something;
	goto dont_do_something;

do_something:
	something;

dont_do_something:

	// You can see how the first success is all you need:
	// Compare that with and below

	if (a && b && c) {
		something;
	}

	if (a) {
		if (b) {
			if (c) {
				something;
			}
		}
	}
	// which in jump form is

	if (a)
		goto a_true;
	goto failure;
a_true:
	if (b)
		goto b_true;
	goto failure;

b_true:
	if (c)
		goto c_true:
	goto failure;

c_true:
	something;
failure:
	
	// Man that's ugly, overcomplicated, and hard to read
	// But what if we did this instead:

	if (!a) goto dont_do_something;
	if (!b) goto dont_do_something;
	if (!c) goto dont_do_something;

	something;

dont_do_something:

	// Clearly you need all successes for and.  In other words
	// to do and directly, you need state, knowledge of past
	// successes.  But what about that second translation of and?
	// It looks a lot like or?

----

You're exactly right.  That final translation of *and* is exactly like *or*.

It takes advantage of De Morgan's laws.{de_morgans}  For those
of you who haven't taken a Digital Logic course (or have forgotten), De
Morgan's laws are 2 equivalencies, a way to change an *or* to an *and*, and vice versa.

They are (in C notation):

`!(A || B) == !A && !B`

`!(A && B) == !A || !B`

Essentially you can think of it as splitting the not across the terms and changing
the logical operation.  The law works for arbitrary numbers of terms, not just 2:

----
(A && B && C)
is really
((A && B) && C)
so when you apply De Morgan's Law recursively you get:
!((A && B) && C) == !(A && B) || !C == !A || !B || !C
----


Let's apply the law to our current compound *and* example.  Of course
the negation of greater or less than comparisons means covering the rest
of the number line so it becomes:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a <= 10 || a >= b))
		goto no_add20;
	c += 20;
no_add20:
	b &= 0xFF;
----

which turns into:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	li     $t9, 10
	ble    $t0, $t9, no_add20      # if (a <= 10) goto no_add20
	bge    $t0, $t1, no_add20      # if (a >= b)  goto no_add20

	addi   $t2, $t2, 20            # c += 20
no_add20:
	andi   $t1, $t1, 0xFF          # b &= 0xFF
----

See how that works?  **Or**'s do not need to remember state.  Just the fact that
you reached a line in a multi-term *or* expression means the previous checks
were false, otherwise you'd have jumped.  If you tried to emulate the same
thing with an *and*, as you saw in the larger snippet above, you'd need a
bunch of extra labels and jumps for each term.

// TODO add example of mixed compond expression if (A || B && C)
What about mixed compound statements?

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a > 10 || c > 100 && b >= c)
		printf("true\n");
	
	b |= 0xAA;
----

Well, the first thing to remember is that `&&` has a higher priority than `||`,
which is why most compilers these days will give a warning for the above code
about putting parenthesis around the `&&` expression to show you meant it (even
though it's completely legal as is).

So with that in mind, let's change it to jump format to better see what we
need to do.  While we're at it, let's apply De Morgan's law to the `&&`.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a > 10)
		goto do_true;
	if (c <= 100)
		goto done_if;
	if (b < c)
		goto done_if;
do_true:
	printf("true\n");

done_if:
	b |= 0xAA;
----

This one is trickier because we don't flip the initial expression like normal.
Instead of jumping _over_ the body which would require testing for the opposite,
we jump to the true case.  We do this because we don't want to have multiple
print statements and it lets us fall through the following conditions.  We would
need multiple print statements because failure for the first expression _is not_
failure for the entire expression.  Here's how it would look otherwise:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	if (a <= 10)
		goto check_and;
	printf("true\n");
	goto done_if;
check_and:
	if (c <= 100)
		goto done_if;
	if (b < c)
		goto done_if;

	printf("true\n");

done_if:
	b |= 0xAA;
----

That is harder to read and has both an extra print and an extra jump.

So let's convert the better version to MIPS (a,b,c = `$t0`, `$t1`, `$t2`):

[source,mips,linenums]
----
.data
true_str: .asciiz "true\n"

.text
	li    $t8, 10   # get the necessary literals in some unused regs
	li    $t9, 100

	bgt   $t0, $t8, do_true   # if (a > 10) goto do_true
	ble   $t2, $t9, done_if   # if (c <= 100) goto done_if
	blt   $t1, $t2, done_if   # if (b < c) goto done_if

do_true:
	li    $v0, 4           # print string
	la    $a0, true_str    # address of str in a0
	syscall

done_if:
	ori   $t1, $t1, 0xAA   # b |= 0xAA
----

		

==== If-Else Chain

Ok, let's look at a larger example.  Say you're trying to determine
a student's letter grade based on their score.  We're going to need a chain
of ``if-else-if``'s to handle all cases.  Assume `score` is declared and
set somewhere before.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	char letter_grade;
	if (score >= 90) {
		letter_grade = 'A';
	} else if (score >= 80) {
		letter_grade = 'B';
	} else if (score >= 70) {
		letter_grade = 'C';
	} else if (score >= 60) {
		letter_grade = 'D';
	} else {
		letter_grade = 'F';
	}

	printf("You got a %c\n", letter_grade);
}
----

With chains like these, you following everything we've learned before, it
comes out looking like this (assuming score is `$t0` and letter_grade is `$t1`):

[source,mips,linenums]
----
.data
grade_str: .asciiz "You got a "

.text
	li     $t1, 70   # letter_grade default to 'F' ascii value
	
	li     $t2, 90
	blt    $t0, $t2, not_a   # if (score < 90) goto not_a
	li     $t1, 65           # leter_grade = 'A'
	j      grade_done

not_a:
	li     $t2, 80
	blt    $t0, $t2, not_b   # if (score < 80) goto not_b
	li     $t1, 66           # leter_grade = 'B'
	j      grade_done

not_b:
	li     $t2, 70
	blt    $t0, $t2, not_c   # if (score < 70) goto not_c
	li     $t1, 67           # leter_grade = 'C'
	j      grade_done

not_c:
	li     $t2, 60
	blt    $t0, $t2, grade_done   # if (score < 60) goto grade_done
	li     $t1, 68           # leter_grade = 'D'

grade_done:
	li     $v0, 4      # print str
	la     $a0, grade_str
	syscall

	li     $v0, 11     # print character
	move   $a0, $t1    # char to print
	syscall

	move   $a0, 10    # print '\n'
	syscall
----
	
You can see how we set a default value and then test for the opposite
of each condition to jump to the next test, until we get one that fails
(aka was true in the original C condition) and set the appropriate grade.

You can arrange chains like this in either direction, it doesn't have to match
the order of the C code.  As long as it works the same, do whatever makes the 
code simpler and more sensible to you.

=== Conclusion

Branching and logic and learning to translate from higher level code to assembly
is something that takes a lot of practice, but eventually it'll become
second nature.  We'll get more practice in the chapter on looping which naturally
also involves branching.

One final note, there's really no reason to use the `slt` family of opcodes _unless_
your professor requires it, ie he says you can't use pseudoinstructions so you're
left with `beq`, `bne`, `j` and the `slt` ops.  I'll show how you can code without
using pseudoinstructions in a later chapter.
