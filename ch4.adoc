== Chapter 4: Loops

[quote, Unknown, Often misattributed to Albert Einstein]
"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results."

Before we get into the MIPS, I want to cover something that may be obvious to some but
may have never occurred to others.  Any loop structure can be converted to any other
(possibly with the addition of an `if` statement).  So a `for` can be written as a `while`
and vice versa.  Even a `do-while` can be written as a `for` or `while` loop.  Let's look
at some equivalencies.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	for (int i=0; i<a; i++) {
		do_something;
	}

	int i = 0;
	while (i < a) {
		do_something;
		i++;
	}

	int i = 0;
	if (i < a) {
		do {
			do_something;
			i++;
		} while (i < a);
	}
	// you could also have an if (i >= a) goto loop_done; to jump over do-while
----

In general, when writing assembly, it can help to think more in terms of `while` or
`do-while` rather than `for` because the former more closely resemble what the
assembly looks like in terms of what goes where.  Like in the last chapter,
where we would think of the `if-else` statements in "jump-form" or "branch-form",
we can do the same here, converting for to while in our head as an intermediary
step before going to assembly.

Speaking of "jump-form", lets apply it to the loop above:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	int i=0;
	if (i >= a)
		goto done_loop;
loop:
	do_something;
	i++
	if (i < a)
		goto loop;

done_loop:
----

You can see how that starts to look more like assembly.  Another thing to note is that
unlike with `if` statements where we test for the opposite to jump over the block of code,
when you're doing the loop test at the bottom like with a `do-while`, it is unchanged
from C because you are jumping to _continue_ the loop.  If you put the test at the top it
becomes inverted, and you put an unconditional jump at the bottom:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	int i=0;
loop:
	if (i >= a)
		goto done_loop;
	do_something;
	i++
	goto loop:

done_loop:
----

In general it's better to test at the bottom, both because the condition matches
the higher level form, and because when you know the loop is going to execute at least once it requires
only one jump + label, rather than 2 since you can forgo the the initial `if` check:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++)
		do_something;

	// becomes

	int i=0;
loop:
	do_something;
	i++
	if (i < a)
		goto loop;
----

Ok, now that we've got the theory and structure out of the way, let's try doing a simple
one in MIPS.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	int sum = 0;
	for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
		sum += i;
	}
----

That's about as basic as it gets, adding up the numbers 0 to 99.

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	li    $t0, 0   # sum = 0
	li    $t1, 1   # i = 1  we can start at 1 because obviously adding 0 is pointless
	li    $t2, 100
loop:
	addi  $t0, $t0, $t1    # sum += i
	addi  $t1, $t1, 1      # i++
	blt   $t1, $t2, loop   # while (i < 100)
----

Ok I don't think there's much point in doing any more without getting to what loops
are most often used for, looping through data structures, most commonly arrays.


=== Looping Through Arrays

Looping and arrays go together like peanut butter and jam.  An array is a sequence of
variables of the same type, almost always related in some way.  Naturally, you
want to operate on them all together in various ways; sorting, searching,
accumulating, etc.  Given that the only way to do that is with loops, in this
section we'll cover different ways of looping through arrays, and dealing with
multi-dimentional arrays.

==== 1D Arrays

Let's pretend there's an array `int numbers[10];` filled with 10 random numbers.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	int total = 0;
	for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
		total += numbers[i];
	}
----

There are several ways to do this.  The first is the most literal translation.

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	li    $t0, 0     # total = 0
	li    $t1, 0     # i = 0
	la    $t2, numbers   # t2 = numbers
	li    $t3, 10
sum_loop:
	sll   $t4, $t1, 2    # t4 = i*sizeof(int) == i*4
	add   $t4, $t4, $t2  # t4 = &numbers[i]
	lw    $t4, 0($t4)    # t4 = numbers[i]
	add   $t0, $t0, $t4  # total += numbers[i]

	addi  $t1, $t1, 1    # i++
	blt   $t1, $t3, sum_loop   # while (i < 10)
----

We initialize the relevant variables beforehand (`numbers` and `$t3` could be set
every iteration but that's less efficient).  Now what's with the `i*4`?  We already
discussed using shifts to multiply and divide by powers of 2 in a previous chapter,
but here we're doing something that higher level languages do automatically for you
every time you do an array access.  When you access the _i_'th element, under the hood
it is multiplying `i` by the size of the type of the array and adding that number of
bytes to the base address and then loading the element located there.

If you're unfamiliar with the C syntax in the comments, `&` means "address of", so
`$t4` is being set to the address of the _i_'th element.  Actually that C syntax is
redundant because the the `&` counteracts the brackets.  In C adding a number to a
pointer does pointer math (ie it multiplies by the size of the items as discussed
above).  This means that the following comparison is true:

`&numbers[i] == numbers + i`

which means that this is true too

`&numbers[0] == numbers`

The reason I use the form on the left in C/C++ even when I can use the right is it
makes it more explicit and obvious that I'm getting the address of an element of an
array.  If you were scanning the code quickly and saw the expression on the right,
you might not realize that's an address at all, it could be some mathematical
expression (though the array name would hopefully clue you in if it was picked well).

Anyway, back to the MIPS code.  After we get the address of the element we want, we
have to actually read it from memory (ie load it).  Since it's an array of words
(aka 4 byte ints) we can use load word, `lw`.

Finally, we add that value to `total`, increment `i`, and perform the loop check.

Now, I said at the beginning that this was the most literal, direct translation
(not counting the restructuring to a `do-while` form).  However, it is not my preferred
form because it's not the simplest, nor the shortest.

Rather than calculate the element address every iteration, why not keep a pointer
to the current element and iterate through the array with it?  In C what I'm suggesting
is this:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	int* p = &numbers[0];
	int i = 0, total = 0;
	do {
		total += *p;
		i++;
		p++;
	} while (i < 10);
----

In other words, we set `p` to point at the first element and then increment it every
step to keep it pointing at `numbers[i]`.  Again, all mathematical operations on pointers
in C deal in increments of the byte syze of the type, so `p++` is really adding `1*sizeof(int)`.


[source,mips,linenums]
----
	li    $t0, 0     # total = 0
	li    $t1, 0     # i = 0
	la    $t2, numbers   # p = numbers
	li    $t3, 10
sum_loop:
	lw    $t4, 0($t2)    # t4 = *p
	add   $t0, $t0, $t4  # total += *p

	addi  $t1, $t1, 1    # i++
	addi  $t2, $t2, 4    # p++  ie p += sizeof(int)
	blt   $t1, $t3, sum_loop   # while (i < 10)
----
	
Now, that may not look much better, we only saved 1 instuction, and if we were
looping through a string (aka an array of characters, `sizeof(char) == 1`) we wouldn't
have saved any.  However, imagine if we weren't using `sll` to do the multiply but
`mult`.  That would take 3 instructions, not 1.  Even `mul` would take 2.  Remember
we _would_ have to use one of those if we were iterating through an array of
structures with a size that wasn't a power of 2.

However, there is one more variant that you can use that can save a few more instructions.
Instead of using `i` and `i<10` to control the loop, use `p` and the address just past the
end of the array.  In C it would be this:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	int* p = &numbers[0];
	int* end = &numbers[10];
	int total = 0;
	do {
		total += *p;
		p++;
	} while (p < end);
----

You could also use `!=` instead of `<`.  This is similar to using the `.end()` method
on many C{plus}{plus} data structures when using iterators.  Now the MIPS version:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	li    $t0, 0     # total = 0
	la    $t2, numbers   # p = numbers
	addi  $t3, $t2, 40   # end = &numbers[10] = numbers + 10*sizeof(int)
sum_loop:
	lw    $t4, 0($t2)    # t4 = *p
	add   $t0, $t0, $t4  # total += *p

	addi  $t2, $t2, 4    # p++  ie p += sizeof(int)
	blt   $t2, $t3, sum_loop   # while (p < end)
----

So we dropped from 10 to 7 instructions and even more if we had had to do `mul`
or `mult` originally.  And this was for a 1D array.  Imagine if you had 2
or 3 indices you had to use to calculate the correct offset.  That's what 
we go over in the next section.


==== 2D Arrays

The first thing to understand is what's really happening when you declare a 2D
array in C.  The contents of a 2D array are tightly packed, in row-major order,
meaning that all the elements from the first row are followed by all the elements
of the second row and so on.  What this means is that a 2D array is equivalent
to a 1D array with rows*cols elements in the same order:

[source,c,linenums]
----
	// The memory of these two arrays are identical
	int array2d[2][4] = { { 1, 2, 3, 4 }, { 5, 6, 7, 8 } };
	int array1d[8] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 };
----

See the code example
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rswinkle/mips_book/master/code/2d_arrays.c[2d_arrays.c] for more details.

What this means is that when we declare a 2D array, it's basically a 1D array with
the size equal to the rows * columns.  Also, when we loop through a 2D array, we can
often treat it like a 1D array with a single loop.  So everything that we learned
before applies.

Let's do an example.

[source,c,linenums]
----
	for (int i=0; i<rows; i++) {
		for (int j=0; j<cols; ++j) {
			array[i][j] = i + j;
		}
	}

	// becomes

	int r, c;
	for (int i=0; i<rows*cols; i++) {
		r = i / cols;
		c = i % cols;
		array[i] = r + c;
	}
----

So assuming `rows` and `cols` are in `$a0` and `$a1` (and nonzero), it would
look like this:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	la    $t0, array    # p = &array[0]
	li    $t1, 0        # i = 0
	mult  $a0, $a1      # a0 = rows, a1 = cols
	mflo  $t2           # t2 = rows * cols
loop:
	div   $t1, $a1
	mflo  $t3           # r = i / cols
	mfhi  $t4           # c = i % cols
	add   $t3, $t3, $t4    # t3 = r + c

	sw    $t3, 0($t0)      # array[i] = *p = r + c

	addi  $t1, $t1, 1      # i++
	addi  $t0, $t0, 4      # p++ (keep pointer in sync with i, aka p = &array[i])
	blt   $t1, $t2, loop   # while (i < rows*cols)
----

You might ask if it's it worth it to convert it to a single loop when you still
need the original `i` and `j` as if you were doing nested loops.  Generally, it is
much nicer to avoid nested loops in assembly if you can.  There are many cases
when you get the best of both worlds though.  If you're doing a clear for example,
setting the entire array to a single value, there's no need to calculate the row
and column like we did here.  I only picked this example to show how you could
get them back if you needed them.

For comparison here's the nested translation (while still taking advantage of
the 1D arrangement of memory and pointer iterators):

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	la    $t0, array    # p = &array[0]
	li    $t1, 0        # i = 0
looprows:
	li    $t2, 0        # j = 0
loopcols:
	add   $t3, $t1, $t2    # t3 = i + j
	sw    $t3, 0($t0)      # array[i][j] = *p = i + j

	addi  $t2, $t2, 1         # j++
	addi  $t0, $t0, 4         # p++ (keep pointer in sync with i and j, aka p = &array[i][j])
	blt   $t2, $a1, loopcols  # while (j < cols)

	addi  $t1, $t1, 1          # i++
	blt   $t1, $a0, looprows   # while (i < rows)
----

It's a bit shorter but again, how much are those extra labels and branching worth?
For me, this one's a toss up.  On the other hand, either of the last 2 versions are
better than the literal translation below:

[source,mips,linenums]
----
	la    $t0, array    # p = &array[0]
	li    $t1, 0        # i = 0
looprows:
	li    $t2, 0        # j = 0
loopcols:
	add   $t3, $t1, $t2    # t3 = i + j

	# need to calculate the byte offset of element array[i][j]
	mult  $t1, $a1
	mflo  $t4              # i * cols

	add   $t4, $t4, $t2    # t4 = i * cols + j

	sll   $t4  $t4, 2      # t4 = (i * cols + j) * sizeof(int)
	add   $t4, $t4, $t0    $ t4 = &array[i][j] (calculated as array + (i*cols + j)*4)

	sw    $t3, 0($t4)      # array[i][j] = i + j

	addi  $t2, $t2, 1         # j++
	blt   $t2, $a1, loopcols  # while (j < cols)

	addi  $t1, $t1, 1          # i++
	blt   $t1, $a0, looprows   # while (i < rows)
----

That chunk in the middle calculating the offset of every element?  Not only is
it far slower than iterating the pointer through the array, but you can
imagine how much worse it would be for a 3D array with 3 nested loops.


=== Conclusion

Hopefully after those examples you have a more solid understanding of looping in
MIPS and how to transform various loops and array accesses into the form
that makes your life the easiest.  There is more we could cover here, like
looping through a linked list, but I think that's beyond the scope of what we've
covered so far.  Perhaps in a later chapter.
