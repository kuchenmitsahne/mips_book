= Chapter 6: Floating Point Types

Up to this point we haven't really mentioned floating point values or instructions
at all, except how to declare them in the `.data` section and the syscalls for
reading and printing them.  There are two reasons we've left them alone till now.
First, they use a whole separate set of registers and opcodes.  Secondly, and
partly because of the first reason, most MIPS college courses do not ever require
you to know or use floating point values.  Since this book is targeted at college
students, if you know you won't need to know this feel free to skip this chapter.

=== Floating Point Registers

While the greensheet contains a nice table for the normal registers it is completely
lacking for the floating point registers.  Fortunately here is a similar table:

.MIPS Floating Point Registers and Uses
[cols="1,1,3,1"]
|===
| Name | Number | Use | Preserved Across a Call

| $zero | 0 | Constant 0 | N.A.

| $at | 1 | Assembler Temporary (used to expand pseudo-ops) | No

| $v0-$v1 | 2-3 | Function Results and Expression Evaluation | No

| $a0-$a3 | 4-7 | Arguments | No

| $t0-$t7 | 8-15 | Temporaries | No

| $s0-$s7 | 16-23 | Saved Temporaries | Yes

| $t8-$t9 | 24-25 | Temporaries | No

| $k0-$k1 | 26-27 | Reserved for OS Kernel | No

| $gp | 28 | Global Pointer | Yes

| $sp | 29 | Stack Pointer | Yes

| $fp (or $s8) | 30 | Frame Pointer if necessary or can be another saved reg | Yes

| $ra | 31 | Return Address | No

.MIPS floating point instructions (and pseudoinstructions)
[cols="3,1,2,2"]
|===
| Name | Opcode | Format | Operation

| Branch On Equal | beq | beq rs, rt, label | if (rs == rt) goto label

| Branch On Not Equal | bne | bne rs, rt, label | if (rs != rt) goto label

| Branch Less Than | blt | blt rs, rt, label | if (rs < rt) goto label

| Branch Greater Than | bgt | bgt rs, rt, label | if (rs > rt) goto label

| Branch Less Than Or Equal | ble | ble rs, rt, label | if (rs <= rt) goto label

| Branch Greater Than Or Equal | bge | bge rs, rt, label | if (rs >= rt) goto label

| Set Less Than | slt | slt rd, rs, rt | rd = (rs < rt) ? 1 : 0

| Set Less Than Immediate | slti | slt rd, rs, imm | rd = (rs < imm) ? 1 : 0

| Set Less Than Immediate Unsigned | sltiu | slt rd, rs, imm | rd = (rs < imm) ? 1 : 0

| Set Less Than Unsigned | sltu | sltu rd, rs, imm | rd = (rs < imm) ? 1 : 0
