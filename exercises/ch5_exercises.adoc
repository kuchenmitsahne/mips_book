. Implement the following functions in MIPS and write a program to demonstrate their use.
You can reuse much of your code from the previous chapter's exercises.
+
[source,c,linenums]
----
// return the min or max
int get_min(int* array, int size);
int get_max(int* array, int size);

// return the index of the min/max
int locate_min(int* array, int size);
int locate_max(int* array, int size);

// return the average of the array
int calc_average(int* array, int size);

. The Collatz conjecture is defined as follows: start with any positive integer n,
if n is even, divide by 2, otherwise, multiply by 3 and add 1.  The conjecture is
that all sequences will eventually reach 1.  Write 2 versions of the collatz function,
one iterative and one recursive.  Print out the sequence as they go.
+
[source,c,linenums]
----
void collatz_iterative(int n);
void collatz_recursive(int n);

// for an added challenge return the number of steps taken to reach 1
// you can remove the printing of the steps
int collatz_iterative2(int n);
int collatz_recursive2(int n);
